# Mood recogonition with convolutional neural network
Machine learning project about training convolutional neural network that classifies images based on their face mood. Augumenting data and training multiple convolutional neural networks in detection of face mood. Data Set contains 30k 48x 48 grayscale images. Training and validation data were obtained from Kaggle.com.
